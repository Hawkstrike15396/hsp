This is an absolute mess since idk what I'm doing. 

But anyways, files:

**setup** opens library and saved/cached objects into R

**data_cleaning** cleans up the data (result.csv) and saves it to a file called clean_data.rds

**models** makes the models, if you haven't already

**save_models** saves those models (of course they have to be in the R environment already)
